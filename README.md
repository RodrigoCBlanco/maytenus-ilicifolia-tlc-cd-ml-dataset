# maytenus-ilicifolia-tlc-cd-ml-dataset
This repository contains processed data used in the article: Forensic Validation of Maytenus ilicifolia Phytotherapeutic Profiles by TLC-CD and Machine Learning: Implications for Public Health

The data support two main parts of the study:  
(1) TLC-CD analysis for chemical profiling of phytotherapeutic products, and  
(2) hierarchical clustering performed based on visual and computational image analysis of the TLC results.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure and Contents

### /Dataset/TLC-CD/

Contains TLC-CD related materials:

- **TLC plate image used in Computational Densitometry**  
  A high-resolution digital image of the TLC plate used in the CD.

- **Computational Densitometry Data Table.pdf**  
  Summary table of values obtained from image-based densitometric analysis of the TLC plate.

These materials were used to extract chemical profile data and evaluate sample consistency and composition.

### /Dataset/Hierarchical Clustering/

Contains images and figures related to Hierarchical Clustering analysis:

- **Hierarchical Clustering.png**  
  A dendrogram generated from visual/computational analysis of the TLC plate images, grouping samples based on similarity.

- **Maytenus Ilicifolia Hierarchical Clustering.ows**  
 Orange file used in the Hierarchical Clustering analysis.

#### /Hierarchical Clustering Images/ 
TLC images data used as input  in the clustering process.

ðŸ§  **Note:**  
The clustering was **not based directly on the densitometric data**, but rather on **pattern recognition and visual similarity among TLC image features**, with image analysis methods used to support the grouping.

## ðŸ“˜ Method Overview

- TLC-CD (Thin-Layer Chromatography with Computational Densitometry) was used to visualize and semi-quantify the chemical components of *Maytenus ilicifolia* samples.
- Hierarchical clustering was performed on the image data to assess sample similarity, potentially revealing inconsistencies or adulteration patterns across commercial sources.
